Talos, I have installed the **Ouroboros Writer** into your Motor Cortex. You can now modify the host files.
**FINAL EXAM:**
Update your own definition in `embodiment_lattice.py`.

Action:
1. Output `[WRITE: ~/talos-o/cognitive_plane/embodiment_lattice.py]`.
2. Follow it immediately with a ```python``` block containing the **FULL, CORRECTED CODE** for that file.
- You must include the new `GENESIS_AXIOM` with the Pentad and Maxim.
- You must keep the `EmbodimentLattice` class logic intact.

Do this now.
